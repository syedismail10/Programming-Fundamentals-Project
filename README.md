# Programming-Fundamentals-Project
The First Project I did within my first year of University!
The hope was to set up a management system that would track and record any changes in inventory, sort out expired medicines and act as an intermediary between manual and automated work.
We achieved what we had hoped for and were sucessful in all of our testing.
